# HyraxDotPlot
HyraxDotPlot can easily generate interactive dot plots from a nucmer alignment, allowing synteny to be visualised between two genomes of interest.  HyraxDotPlot can also support qualitative feature bed files (e.g.: presence of specific genes of interest or telomeres); and quantitative bed files which can be loaded as tracks (e.g.: read coverage).
